Creating train and test datasetÂ¶
Train/Test Split involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets respectively, which are mutually exclusive. After which, you train with the training set and test with the testing set. This will provide a more accurate evaluation on out-of-sample accuracy because the testing dataset is not part of the dataset that have been used to train the model. Therefore, it gives us a better understanding of how well our model generalizes on new data.

We know the outcome of each data point in the testing dataset, making it great to test with! Since this data has not been used to train the model, the model has no knowledge of the outcome of these data points. So, in essence, it is truly an out-of-sample testing.

Let's split our dataset into train and test sets. Around 80% of the entire dataset will be used for training and 20% for testing. We create a mask to select random rows using the np.random.rand() function:

"""

msk = np.random.rand(len(df)) < 0.8

print (msk)

train = cdf[msk]
test = cdf[~msk]

print (test)
